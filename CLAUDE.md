# CLAUDE.md — steps-tracker (Flutter app)

## Core principle: never break users on older app versions

The app talks to a shared backend (`steptracker-api.org`) that is updated
independently of the app. Two facts follow:

1. **A shipped app binary is frozen.** Once a version is on the App Store, those
   users keep it until they choose to update — App Store rollout is **phased
   over ~a week**, and some users **never update**. Code you change today only
   reaches a user when they install a new build.
2. **The backend may be newer (or older) than the running app.** Don't assume
   the app and backend are on the same version.

So **every change — frontend or backend — must keep working for users on
previous app versions.** This is the first thing to check for any change,
before correctness or style.

### Rules that follow from this
- **Read API responses defensively.** A field may be missing or null because
  the backend is a different version than this build expects. Default safely;
  don't crash on absent/null fields.
- **Don't make the app depend on a brand-new backend field/endpoint** without
  confirming the backend already returns it in prod (old app versions and the
  current backend must both be satisfied).
- **Backend changes are the bigger risk** here: the prod backend serves *all*
  app versions at once. When changing API shape, ensure the backend keeps a
  compat path for older clients (see the backend repo's `CLAUDE.md`).
- **Build-time config is baked in.** `BACKEND_BASE_URL` is injected via
  `--dart-define` at build (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`); a wrong value ships a broken
  binary that can't be hotfixed without a new App Store submission.

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for build/release flow.
